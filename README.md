🧭 Reverse Location Saver
Overview


This script was originally built for a custom framework, but can easily be adapted to work with any environment — simply replace or integrate the server-side functions according to your framework’s logic.

✨ Features

- Saves player coordinates automatically

- Loads the last known position when a player reconnects

- Minimal resource usage — optimized for performance

- Modular code for simple integration and customization

⚙️ How It Works

When a player disconnects, their current coordinates are saved to the database.

When they reconnect, the script checks the database and restores their previous location.
