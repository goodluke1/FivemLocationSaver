üß≠ Reverse Location Saver
Overview

Reverse Location Saver is a lightweight and efficient script designed to handle player location data on a custom framework.
It allows you to save and restore player positions (coordinates) directly from a database, without consuming unnecessary resources or causing performance issues.

This script was originally built for a custom framework, but can easily be adapted to work with any environment ‚Äî simply replace or integrate the server-side functions according to your framework‚Äôs logic.

‚ú® Features

- Saves player coordinates automatically or manually

- Loads the last known position when a player reconnects

 Minimal resource usage ‚Äî optimized for performance

-  Clean database structure for easy management

- Modular code for simple integration and customization

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

When a player disconnects, their current coordinates are saved to the database.

When they reconnect, the script checks the database and restores their previous location.

The system does not rely on heavy loops or tick functions ‚Äî everything runs only on events to keep performance optimal.
